"""
An Invoice represents a bill sent from one company to another. The 
creator of the invoice is identified by the `CompanyId` field, and the 
recipient of the invoice is identified by the `CustomerId` field. Most 
invoices are uniquely identified both by a Lockstep Platform ID number 
and a customer ERP "key" that was generated by the system that 
originated the invoice. Invoices have a total amount and a due date, and 
when some payments have been made on the Invoice the `TotalAmount` and 
the `OutstandingBalanceAmount` may be different.
